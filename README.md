# TowerDefense
Basic tower defense game coded in Java for my grade eleven computer science final project.

This game was coded using the Greenfoot API, you can download this entire repository and run the project.greenfoot file to run the project through greenfoot.
However, if you wish to simply play the game without looking at the code, simply download the TowerDefense.jar file and run it and have fun!

I used a 2D array in order to create the map for the towers and enemies and used a variety of classes in order to create multiple enemies of different types.
